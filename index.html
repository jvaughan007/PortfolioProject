            <h3>About Me</h3>
          </header>
          <p class = "about-me"> I began my journey to code during the COVID-19 crisis. After completing a contract position in April of 2020, I decided to pass the time by self teaching myself web development through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> and other free resources.</p>
          <p class = "about-me">   One day, while taking a little break from my free learning resources, I stumbed upon an ad for <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, and decided to look in to it. After researching for a while, I became determined to make a career change. I was captivated by the skill that allowed me to create and perform anything that came to mind. I fell in love with the process and jumped in full-time.</p>
          <p class = "about-me">   If you are seeking a new software developer or engineer, please feel free to <a href="index.html#contact" class = "link">Contact Me</a>! I am excited to continue on this path to work in the industry I have now found so much passion for!</p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Being a lifelong gaming enthusiast, I enjoy...</p>
