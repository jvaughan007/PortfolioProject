          <p>
            I began my journey to code during the COVID-19 crisis. After
            completing a contract position in April of 2020, I decided to pass
            the time by self teaching myself web development through
            FreeCodeCamp and other free resources. This idea came to me when a
            few friends of mine decided they wanted to create a mobile app.
            Needless to say, it was the only excuse I needed to learn to code -
            a chance to work with some awesome people as part of a team to
            create something useful!
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, during a little longboarding break from my free learning
            resources, I stumbed upon an ad for Thinkful while scrolling through
            facebook on my phone and decided to look in to it. After researching
            for a while, I became determined to make a career change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that day, I have fallen in love with coding - from designing
            gorgeous and intuitive front-ends, to efficient and functional
            back-end. The opportunity to create things from scratch and develop
            applications and websites that are needed in todays world allows me
            the unique opportunity to solve problems and provide an avenue to
            provide a service to those around me!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are seeking a new software developer or engineer, please feel
            free to reach out! I am excited to continue on this path to work in
            the industry I have now found so much passion for! I am willing and
            able, currently, to assist in any and all web-development projects.
            I look forward to hearing from you, and many thanks for checking out
            my online portfolio!
